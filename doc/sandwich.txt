QUICK START				*sandwich-quick-start*

*sandwich.vim* is the set of operator and textobject plugins to
add/delete/replace surroundings of a sandwiched textobject, like (foo), "bar".

add~
Press sa{motion/textobject}{addition}.
For example, saiw( makes foo to (foo).

delete~
Press sdb or sd{deletion}.
For example, sdb or sd( makes (foo) to foo.
sdb searchs a set of surrounding automatically.

replace~
Press srb{addition} or sr{deletion}{addition}.
For example, srb" or sr(" makes (foo) to "foo".

That's all. Now you already know enough about sandwich.vim. If you want more,
read following descriptions and each help for operator/textobject,
|operator-sandwich| and |textobj-sandwich|.



==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION				*sandwich-introduction*

This plugin provides functions to add/delete/replace surroundings of
sandwiched texts. These functions are implemented genuinely by utilizing
operator/textobject framework. Their action can be repeated by |.| command
without any dependency. It consists of two parts, |operator-sandwich| and
|textobj-sandwich|. These two cooperate gracefully to realize the
functionality. However, at the same time, each of them are independent, thus
they could work with any other operators/textobjects.

|operator-sandwich| gives three kinds of operators,
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|, |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)|,
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)|. These operators edit sandwiched text.

|textobj-sandwich| gives four kinds of textobjects,
|<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-i)|, |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)|,
|<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-i)|, |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-a)|.
These textobjects search and select sandwiched text.



==============================================================================
KEYMAPPINGS				*sandwich-keymappings*

This plugin defines the following keymappings.

function	default keymappings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
add		sa{motion/textobject}{addition}	(normal and visual mode)

delete		sd				(visual mode)
		sdb				(normal mode)
		sd{deletion}			(normal mode)

replace		sr{addition}			(visual mode)
		srb{addition}			(normal mode)
		sr{deletion}{addition}		(normal mode)

textobjct	ib			(operator-pending and visual mode)
		ab			(operator-pending and visual mode)
		is			(operator-pending and visual mode)
		as			(operator-pending and visual mode)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: To prevent unintended operation, the following setting is strongly
      recommended to add to your vimrc.
>
	nmap s <Nop>
	xmap s <Nop>
<
      |s| could be easily replaced by |c|l| commands.



The detailed breakdown is described below.

  * |operator-sandwich|
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)| which is a operator to add surroundings is
mapped to the key sequences sa. This is valid in both normal and visual modes.

|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| which is a operator to delete surroundings
is mapped to the key sequences sd in visual mode. If the both ends of the
selected region are the same characters or the set of registered surroundings,
then it deletes them.

|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| which is a operator to replace
surroundings is mapped to the key sequences sr in visual mode. If the both
ends of the selected region are the same characters or the set of registered
surroundings, then it replaces them.



  * |textobj-sandwich|
|<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-i)| and |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)| which
are the textobjects to search and select a sandwiched text automatically are
mapped to the key sequences ib and ab. They are valid in both operator-pending
mode and visual mode. ib selects the text inside the surroundings. ab selects
the text including surroundings.

|<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-i)| and |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-a)|
which are the textobjects to search and select a sandwiched text depending on
user input are mapped to the key sequences is and as. They are valid in both
operator-pending mode and visual mode. is selects the text inside the
surroundings. as selects the text including surroundings.



In addition to the above, the key sequences sd, sdb, sr and srb in normal mode
is used by compound mappings of |operator-sandwich| and |textobj-sandwich|.
Each of them are the short-hand mappings as following keysequences.

  sd
>
	<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-a)
<
  sdb
>
	<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)
<
  sr
>
	<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-query-a)
<
  srb
>
	<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)
<
This is just for convenience, since these textobjects perfectly fills up the
working condition of these operators. Users only have to assign surroundings
as listed above. If you don't like the short-hands, define
g:sandwich_no_default_key_mappings in your vimrc.
>
	let g:sandwich_no_default_key_mappings = 1
<
NOTE: In fact, these compound keymappings have one more key sequence
      |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-release-count)| in between the two key
      sequences. It is a tiny trick for the [count] handling. For example the
      key sequences 2sdb is identical to:
>
	<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)2<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)
<
      It searches the second closest sandwiched text and deletes them.
>
	      #                            : cursor
	[bar(foo)baz]   --->   bar(foo)baz
<



==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				*sandwich-configuration*

A set of surroundings and options for it is called "recipe". Each recipe is a
dictionary and the |list|s of recipes determines the operator's behavior and
textobject's behavior.  |g:sandwich#default_recipes| is one of the |list|s of
recipes. This is shared to be used by |operator-sandwich| and
|textobj-sandwich| since it is convenient in many cases. If
|g:sandwich#recipes| is defined by user, it is employed alternatively. The
default recipes |g:sandwich#default_recipes| can be checked by |:echo|
command.
>
	:echo g:sandwich#default_recipes
<
Besides them, |g:operator#sandwich#recipes| and |g:textobj#sandwich#recipes|
can be used. They are used only by |operator-sandwich| and |textobj-sandwich|
respectively.

About the contents of a recipe, please see |operator-sandwich-configuration|
and |textobj-sandwich-configuration|.



g:sandwich#recipes			*g:sandwich#recipes*
	This is one of the lists of recipes which is referred from both
	|operator-sandwich| and |textobj-sandwich|. If this list does not
	exist, |g:sandwich#default_recipes| is used.



g:sandwich#default_recipes		*g:sandwich#default_recipes*
	This is one of the lists of recipes which is prepared in default. If
	|g:sandwich#recipes| exists, it will be used alternatively.
>
  let g:sandwich#default_recipes = [
    \   {'buns': ['<', '>'], 'expand_range': 0, 'match_syntax': 1},
    \
    \   {
    \     'buns': ['"', '"'],
    \     'quoteescape': 1, 'expand_range': 0,'nesting': 0, 'match_syntax': 1,
    \     'syntax': ['String', 'Statement', 'Special'],
    \     'inner_syntax': ['String', 'PreProc', 'Special'],
    \   },
    \
    \   {
    \     'buns': ["'", "'"],
    \     'quoteescape': 1, 'expand_range': 0,'nesting': 0, 'match_syntax': 1,
    \     'syntax': ['String', 'Statement', 'Special'],
    \     'inner_syntax': ['String', 'PreProc', 'Special'],
    \   },
    \
    \   {
    \     'buns': ['{', '}'],
    \     'nesting': 1, 'match_syntax': 1, 'skip_break': 1
    \   },
    \
    \   {'buns': ['[', ']'], 'nesting': 1, 'match_syntax': 1},
    \
    \   {'buns': ['(', ')'], 'nesting': 1, 'match_syntax': 1},
    \ ]
<
	This variable is locked usually, but it can be copied when you declare
	|g:sandwich#recipes| if you need.
>
	:let g:sandwich#recipes = deepcopy(g:sandwich#default_recipes)
